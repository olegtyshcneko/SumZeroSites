    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sum Zero</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 15, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application "Sum Zero" (the "Application") for mobile devices. This policy is intended to help you understand what information we collect, why we don't collect it, and how we handle the information you may provide to us.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use - We Collect Nothing</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. The Application is designed to be a completely anonymous experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Sum Zero does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information about its users.</strong></p>
    <p>The game is fully functional without requiring you to provide any personal data. We do not use any analytics, trackers, or third-party SDKs that could gather information about you, your device, or your gameplay.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.</li>
        <li><strong>No Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect data about how you use the Application, such as your game progress, scores, or time spent playing.</li>
        <li><strong>No Device Information:</strong> We do not collect any information from your device, such as device ID, IP address, operating system, or browser type.</li>
        <li><strong>No Permissions Required:</strong> The Application does not request any permissions to access your device's features or data (e.g., contacts, storage, camera).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information You Provide Via Email</h2>
    <p>The only way we might receive personal information from you is if you voluntarily contact us for support via our email address: <a href="mailto:lotierm@gmail.com">lotierm@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If you contact us via email, we will use your email address and any information you provide solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry. We will not use this information for marketing purposes or share it with third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Children's Privacy (COPPA and GDPR)</h2>
    <p>While Sum Zero is designed to be suitable for players of all ages, it is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain European countries). </p>
    <p>In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the Application does not collect any data, we do not believe we are in possession of any such information.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information (for example, by sending an email), please contact us at <a href="mailto:lotierm@gmail.com">lotierm@gmail.com</a>. We will immediately delete any such information from our records.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect any personal information, many of the rights provided by privacy laws such as the GDPR (e.g., right to access, rectification, erasure) are not applicable. However, you have the right to be informed about how your data is (or, in this case, is not) processed, which is the purpose of this policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
